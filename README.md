# Boids

This is an extension of [The Coding Trains Flocking Simulation](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/124-flocking-simulation)

It uses the HTML Canvas to draw the graphics.

I have extended the flock to have 4 different 'spices', each with a different color.

The spices have different behavior and speed. They try to avoid the other spices.

The overall behaviors can be set at the burger menu top left.
